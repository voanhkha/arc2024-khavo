This is part of my solution for the prestigious $1.1M ARC Prize 2024 challenge, hosted by Kaggle and Francois Chollet.
The objective of this solution is to analyze the impact of deep learning pattern recognition (CNN) on the program synthesis solver.

The solution is divided into 3 main parts, represented by 3 python notebooks.

1. Construct the dataset (hodel_dsl_to_dataset.ipynb) - Complete
2. Training a multi-label CNN and Preliminary Analysis (kha-vo-arc-prize-2024-cnn.ipynb) - Complete
3. Implement the CNN's out-of-fold probability distributions to Program Synthesis Solver and Analysis on the Outcome - to come as soon as possible!
